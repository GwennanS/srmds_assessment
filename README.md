# CS4125 - 2020-2021 Seminar Research Methodology for Data Science

ASSESSMENT METHODS WHICH ENABLE STUDENT TO DEMONSTRATE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE MODULE:

Course will be assessed on 3 coursework assignments.
- A. Analysis of experimental research data (40%)
- B. Exploration of real-world data set (20%)
- C. Linear and nonlinear dimensional reduction (40%)

Students work in small groups on the 3 assignments. For each assignment, the student group submit a report and give a presentation including a question-and-answer round where individual group members are assessed on the coursework. The final course mark is the weighted average of the three assignment marks. Note that, there is a minimum grade of 5.0 for each assignment grade and an average grade for all components of at least a 5.8 in order to pass the course. Also, marks for individual assignments do not carry to the next year.Resit next quarterResubmission of modified coursework is only allowed for assignments that received a fail mark (<5.0). Overall resit mark will be capped to 6.
