# Lecture 2: Experimental design, reliability, and validity

## Causality
- Correlation between the variables.  
  _(If A changes, B should change)_
- Temporal asymmetry (time precedence) between the variables.  
  _(A happens before B happens)_
- Elimination of any common causal variable (confounding variables).  
  _(A happens because of B, not because of some other factor C)_

## Reliability
The stability or consistency with which we measure something.

## Validity
Accuracy of a result.

### Internal Validity
- **History**  
  Things that have changed in the participantsâ€™ environment other than caused by independent variable.
- **Testing**  
  Changing caused by pre-test
- **Instrumentation**  
  Change caused by difference in measurement instrumentation between pre-test and post-test .
- **Regression**  
  Statistical regression: a problem of extreme values or a tendency for random errors to move group results toward the average
  - Select extreme group (more likely to become less extreme).
  - Extreme score on a test likely to become less extreme in a second test.
- **Mortality**  
  Participant dropping out of the experiment (what was the cause?
- **Maturation**  
  Growth, change or development in participants unrelated to independent variable.
- **Selection**  
  Initial difference between groups prior to study (participants will not form equivalent groups).
- **Selection by maturation interaction**  
  Initial groups are equal but over time change by maturation which is not caused by independent variable.
- **Ambiguity about causal direction**  
  Is the independent variable causing change in dependent variable or the other way around?
- **Diffusion of treatment**  
  Groups/conditions are effecting change in other groups/conditions. (e.g. members of one group are talking with members of another group).
- **Compensatory equalization of treatments**  
  Situation where control group needs to be compensated because they did not receive treatment.
- **Compensatory rivalry**  
  Group members change their behaviour to rival member in another group
