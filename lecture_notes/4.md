# Lecture 4: Generalized linear models

## Frequency tables
x^2 = sum ((O-E)^2 / E)  
where O = observed and E = expected

## Chi square test
1. Independence of observations.
2. Nominal data.
3. Each observed person (or case) must appear in only one of the frequency cells.
4. No more than 20% of the expected frequency cell counts should be less tahn 5 in large contingency table. For small tables each expected frequency cell count should be greater than 5.

*“There was a significant association between User interface Type and whether or not having completed the task χ2 (2, N = 190) = 29.98, p < .001.”*

## Comparing with a constant
Compare with the norm.  
1. Independence of observations.
2. Interval (or ratio) data.
3. Data are from normally distributed population.
4. Error is normal distributed.

*"The participants rated the File Control (M = 5.90, SD = 1.68) higher than the norm value of 5.29, t (33) = 2.12, p = .042."*

## Comparing between two groups  
1. Independence of observations.
2. Interval (or ratio) data.
3. Data are from normally distributed population.
4. Homogeneity of variance (variances in populations are roughly equal)

Model comparison: f() = a vs f(x) = a + bx

*"Students that received textual corrective feedback did not hadve significantly (t (59) = 1.37, p = .18) different post test score (M = 109.52, SD = 19.93) that the students that received textual corrective and explanatory feedback (M = 116.17, SD = 18.04).*

## Paired comparison

*"On average students scored significantly higher (F(1,90), p < .001, B = -29.12) after the training (M = 113.13, SD = 21.27) than before the training (M = 84.01 , SD = 19.77)."
